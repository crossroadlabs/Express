Using [Express](http://swiftexpress.io) is rather easy. To create a project you just need to type:

```sh
swift-express init YourProject
```

ant it will create you the whole directory structure along with xCode project.

You can run your project by typing following test while in the project folder:

```sh
swift-express run
```
